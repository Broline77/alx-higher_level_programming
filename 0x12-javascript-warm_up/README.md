# 0x12-javascript-warm_up

## Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to run a JavaScript script
- How to create variables and constants
- What are differences between var, const and let
- What are all the data types available in JavaScript
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use while and for loops
- How to use break and continue statements
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does a function that does not use any return statement return
- Scope of variables
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to manipulate dictionary
- How to import a file

### TASK 0:
Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

- You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 1:
Write a script that prints 3 lines:

- The first line: “C is fun”
- The second line: “Python is cool”
- The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 2:
Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:

- If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
- If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
- Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
Reference: process.argv

### TASK 3:
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

- If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You are not allowed to use length

### TASK 4:
Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 5:
Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:

- If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You are not allowed to use try/catch

### TASK 6:
Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

- The first line: “C is fun”
- The second line: “Python is cool”
- The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You are not allowed to use any if/else statement
- You can use only one console.log
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

### TASK 7:
Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”

- Where x is the first argument of the script
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You can use only two console.log
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

### TASK 8:
Write a script that prints a square

- The first argument is the size of the square
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
- You must use the character X to print the square
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

### TASK 9:
Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers

- The first argument is the first integer
- The second argument is the second integer
- You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 10:
Write a script that computes and prints a factorial

- The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
- Factorial of NaN is 1
- You must do it recursively
- You must use a function
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 11:

Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

- You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
- If no argument passed, print 0
- If the number of arguments is 1, print 0
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var## TASK 12:

### TASK 12:
Update this script to replace the value 12 with 89:

- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 13:
Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.

- The function must be visible from outside
- The name of the function must be add
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 14:
Write a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333

vagrant@atesh:~/0x12$ cat 100-main.js
#!/usr/bin/node
myVar = 89;
require('./100-let_me_const')
console.log(myVar);
vagrant@atesh:~/0x12$ ./100-main.js
333
vagrant@atesh:~/0x12$ 

### TASK 15:
Write a function that executes x times a function.

- The function must be visible from outside
- Prototype: function (x, theFunction)
- You are not allowed to use var

### TASK 16:
Write a function that increments and calls a function.

- The function must be visible from outside
- Prototype: function (number, theFunction)
- You are not allowed to use var
